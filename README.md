# Is waking up someone on a plane to use the bathroom considered rude?

I found this data to be very interesting because I always wonder the same thing when I go on planes. I am always mindful of how much water I drink if I sit in the window or middle seat so that I do not disturbe the person next to me. I always have an  internal dilemma on whether I really need to go or not, just because I want to avoid causing any conflict with the person next to me, *especially* on long flights. 

The bar chart below shows the contray to my beliefs. It shows that many people do not find it rude to ask to use the bathroom.
